This tool provides a visual way to generate a set of coordinates for the exclusion zone feature on Cisco Devices. 

Use the drawing canvas to create a polygon and then copy the coordinates into your devices camera configuration. 

This tool also allows for the upload of a screenshot or UI capture to help aid with the drawing.

NOTE: This tool is configured to show only coordinates for the Quad Camera.
